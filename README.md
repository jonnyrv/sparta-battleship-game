# Pirates and Treasures 

Code for a game that I created in a week.

## Purpose

**Pirates and Treasures** served as a challenge for me to create a game in 4 days by using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. 

This project helped me get a more indepth knowledge of javaScript and jQuery by having to create a working game from scrath. 

After to project I have a better understanding of functions in javaScript and jQuery.


##Functionality 

This is a simple game that takes a data from a table when you click on one of the tables squares and returns the data of the square. That way it can indetify it there is a "ship" or not there.

## Implementation
The functionality has been implemented using the following features: 
  
* HTML5

* well-structured CSS

* JavaScript with jQuery

##Running 

To run/play the game you need to open index.html in your browser by double clicking on it.
